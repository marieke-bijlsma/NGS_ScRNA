<h1>NGS_ScRNA</h1>

The sequencer is producing reads (in FastQ format) and are aligned to the hg19 reference genome with Hisat (Daehwan Kim et al. <sup>1</sup>).
Dropseq (Macosko EZ et al [3]) was used for flaging individual cells and UMI's. The gene level quantification was performed again by using 
Dropseq filtering readcount on unique UMI's. Picard tools (Picard Sourceforge <sup>2</sup>) is used for sorting, merging or format converting SAM/BAM files.
